# Pong
This Pong Game is Written Entirely in SDL2 and C++, This Game would use MakeFile and No Other IDE, the aim is to basically stop the use of IDEs, because I would benefit in the long run...

## Idea Behind This Project
The Current Idea is to just basically make the pong game in C++ and SDL2, but, without using any IDE, I thought that Pong is the easiest game, so I just took a small step and here it is, everything created in my IDE using Nothing But Sublime Text and the Terminal.
